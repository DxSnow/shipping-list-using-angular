## Description
simple shopping list manager using Angular, Bootstrap 5, customized CSS, bootstrap icon.

I was given this 2017 instruction and my task is to make it work in 2021: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-grocery-list-manager-using-angular-part-1-add-display-items--cms-28586  Many thanks to the author for writing it.

The challenge to me is that, because of software and language updates, I had many bugs following this instruction made 4 years ago. The exciting part is, I enjoyed solving bugs ~

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
